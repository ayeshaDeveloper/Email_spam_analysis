Since the file you've uploaded is a Jupyter notebook (.ipynb) and not a typical text or PDF file, I'll convert and analyze its content to draft a README file for your GitHub repository. Let's proceed by examining the notebook content first. I'll extract the information and create a README based on the sections, code, comments, and outputs within the notebook.
# Spam Emails Analysis

## Overview
This project is designed to analyze and classify emails into spam and non-spam categories using Python and machine learning techniques. The notebook demonstrates the preprocessing of email text data, feature extraction, and the application of a classification model.

## Dataset
The dataset used in this project is a collection of spam and non-spam emails:
- **Source**: Dataset is loaded from a CSV file (`spam.csv`).
- **Encoding**: ISO-8859-1
- **Preview**: The first 10 rows of the dataset are displayed to understand the structure.

## Dependencies
This project requires the following Python libraries:
- Keras
- Pandas

To install these libraries, you can use the following command:
```bash
pip install keras pandas
```

## Features and Preprocessing
- **Tokenization and Padding**: Emails are tokenized and sequences are padded to prepare the data for model training.
- **Data Splitting**: Data is split into input texts (`x`) and labels (`y`).

## Model
Details about the specific machine learning model used (e.g., neural network architectures) are not extracted from the initial cells previewed. If a specific model like a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) or a Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) network is used, please provide this information here.

## Usage
To run the analysis:
1. Load the dataset.
2. Perform preprocessing on the dataset.
3. Train the model.
4. Evaluate the model's performance.
